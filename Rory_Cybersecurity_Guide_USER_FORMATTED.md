## ✊ Real Talk – My Jump Into Security

I was working in a **NOC (Network Ops Center)** for two years and some change.  
Had a degree in Computer Systems from CUNY, focused on network security, but no certs and no in.

So I studied *after work*, passed my **Security+**, and started applying like my life depended on it.

When I finally landed my first **security analyst role**, I was shook by how much that studying helped.  
**I could actually hang** with senior engineers. I knew the words, the tools, the flow.

I read the Security+ book cover to cover.  
Watched **Professor Messer** on YouTube for stuff that didn’t click.  
Made flashcards. Lurked **/r/CompTIA** for what tools people used.  
It wasn’t glamorous — it was *grindcore*.

🔑 **Key Takeaways**:  
- Knowledge = presence. Don’t underestimate flashcards and thorough studying.  
- Certs aren't magic—but they open doors and boost your confidence.  
- DIY learning can absolutely work. Stay consistent, be curious, and adapt resources to your style.

## 👾 What About Coding?

So... do you *have* to code to get into cyber?  
**Short answer: no.** But it helps.

I’m neurodivergent and avoided code for *most* of my career.  
I tried **Automate the Boring Stuff**, Udemy, and LinkedIn Learning courses.  
Nada stuck. My brain said, “nope.” 🙅

What *did* work:
- **Codecademy’s Python track** – hands-on, no fluff  
- **PentesterLab** – for code review & real-world exploits  
- Friends walking me through **LeetCode Easy** problems. (Shoutout to them fr.)  
- Treating it like a puzzle, not a chore  

🔑 **Key Takeaways**:  
- You don’t need to become a full-stack dev—just learn enough to speak attacker (or defender).  
- Coding isn’t required for GRC, policy, or training roles; it helps in SOC, threat hunting, and automation; and is essential for AppSec, red-teaming, and reversing.  
- If you’re neurodivergent or resistant to coding, try hands-on, puzzle-like resources first, and lean on supportive friends or communities.

### Coding TL;DR:
- ❌ Not needed for: GRC, policy, training  
- ✅ Helpful for: SOC, threat hunting, automation  
- 💻 Required for: AppSec, red teaming, reversing
